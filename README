   🔹 **Field Oriented Control (FOC):** Efficient & precise for PMSM motors.
   🔹 **Six-Step Commutation:** Simpler, mostly for BLDC motors.

📌 **Key Functionalities for PMSM Motor Control**

⚡ **Field Oriented Control (FOC):**
🟢 **Space Vector PWM (SVPWM):** Efficient voltage control for smooth motor operation.
🟢 **Speed & Torque Control Modes:** Switch between speed and torque control dynamically.
🟢 **Position Control Mode:** Uses encoders for accurate control.
🟢 **Open Loop & Closed Loop Operation:**
   🔸 **Open Loop:** No speed/position control.
   🔸 **Closed Loop:** Uses feedback for precision.

🛠 **Rotor Speed & Position Feedback:**
🔹 **Sensorless Methods:**
   🔹 Back-EMF State Observer (with PLL or CORDIC).
   🔹 High Sensitivity Observer (HSO) – Works well at low speeds.
🔹 **Sensored Methods:**
   🔹 Hall Sensors (60° or 120° placement).
   🔹 Quadrature Encoder (for precise control).

🔥 **Advanced Features:**
✅ On-the-Fly Startup – Detects if the motor is already spinning before startup.
✅ Flux Weakening – Increases motor speed beyond its rated speed.
✅ Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) – Optimizes torque output.
✅ Discontinuous PWM & Overmodulation – Improves motor efficiency.
✅ Real-time Tuning – Adjust PI/PID regulators, observer parameters, startup procedures, etc.

📌 **Fault Management & Protection**

🛡 **Safety Mechanisms:**

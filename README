Step-by-Step Guide to Using
X-CUBE-MCSDK for STM32 with PMSM Motors
To fully understand and remember
how to use X-CUBE-MCSDK for PMSM motor control, let's break it
down into logical steps, explaining when and how to use each
feature.


Step 1: Install & Set Up
the Environment
Before working with motor
control, you need to set up the tools.
1.1 Install Required Software
‚úÖ Download & Install:

 STM32CubeIDE ‚Äì For coding & debugging.

 X-CUBE-MCSDK ‚Äì Motor control software
     package.

 ST Motor Control Workbench ‚Äì GUI tool to
     configure motor parameters.

 STM32CubeMX ‚Äì To configure STM32
     peripherals.


Step 2: Hardware Connections
& Selection
2.1 Choose & Connect STM32
Board
Depending on your application,
select a supported STM32 board, such as:

 STM32F4 Series (e.g., STM32F407)

 STM32G4 Series (e.g., STM32G431)

 STM32H7 Series (for high-performance applications)
2.2 Select Motor Driver &
Power Board
You need:

 Power Board (Inverter Board) ‚Äì Converts DC
     voltage to drive motor.

 Motor Control Board ‚Äì Controls switching of
     power board.
üîå Connect the
components:

 Connect STM32 board ‚Üí Motor Control Board.

 Connect Power Board ‚Üí PMSM motor.

 Connect Hall Sensors / Encoder (if using a
     sensored motor).


Step 3: Configure the Motor in
ST Motor Control Workbench
Now, configure the motor
control system using ST Motor Control Workbench.
3.1 Open ST Motor Control
Workbench

 Select New Project.

 Choose the STM32 microcontroller you are
     using.
3.2 Select Control Method

 Field Oriented Control (FOC) ‚Äì For smooth
     control, high efficiency (Recommended for PMSM).

 Six-Step Commutation ‚Äì Simpler method (For
     BLDC).
üëâ When to Use:

 Use FOC for PMSM motors (better torque &
     efficiency).

 Use Six-Step for BLDC motors (simpler &
     cheaper).


3.3 Configure Motor Parameters
Fill in your motor‚Äôs
specifications:

 Number of Pole Pairs: (e.g., 4 for an 8-pole
     motor)

 Rated Voltage & Current: (e.g., 24V, 2A)

 Motor Resistance (R): (e.g., 0.5Œ©)

 Motor Inductance (L): (e.g., 0.3mH)
üìù Tip: If you
don't have exact values, use ST Motor Profiler (in ST Motor Pilot) to
measure them.


3.4 Configure Motor Control
Options
Speed/Torque Control Mode:

 Speed Mode ‚Üí Maintains constant RPM.

 Torque Mode ‚Üí Controls motor torque.
üëâ When to Use:

 Use Speed Mode if you need constant rotation
     speed.

 Use Torque Mode for applications like EVs
     (controlling force applied).


3.5 Select Feedback Type
(Sensorless or Sensored)

 Sensorless (Back-EMF Estimation) ‚Äì Uses
     mathematical models.

 Sensored (Hall Sensors or Encoder) ‚Äì Uses
     actual feedback.
üëâ When to Use:

 Use Sensorless for cost-effective designs.

 Use Sensored for low-speed control or
     precise positioning.


3.6 Configure PWM & Current
Sensing

 PWM Type:

 
  Space Vector PWM (SVPWM) ‚Äì Recommended for
      high efficiency.

  Six-Step PWM ‚Äì Use only for BLDC motors.

 

 Current Sensing:

 
  Single Shunt ‚Äì Uses 1 resistor (cheaper,
      less accurate).

  Three Shunt ‚Äì Uses 3 resistors (better
      accuracy).

 
üëâ When to Use:

 Use Three Shunt for better motor
     performance.

 Use Single Shunt if cost is a constraint.


3.7 Set Protection Mechanisms
Enable:

 Over-Current Protection ‚Äì Prevents damage
     from high current.

 Under/Over Voltage Protection ‚Äì Ensures
     stable operation.

 Overheating Protection ‚Äì Monitors
     temperature.
üëâ Why?

 These prevent motor driver failure and
     ensure safe operation.


Step 4: Generate & Upload
Code
4.1 Generate Code from
Workbench

 Click "Generate Code".

 This creates a project with motor control firmware.
4.2 Open Code in STM32CubeIDE
